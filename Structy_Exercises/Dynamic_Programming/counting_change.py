'''
Write a function, counting_change, that takes in an amount and a list of coins. 
The function should return the number of different ways it is possible to make 
change for the given amount using the coins.

You may reuse a coin as many times as necessary.

For example,

counting_change(4, [1,2,3]) -> 4

There are four different ways to make an amount of 4:

1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2. 1 + 1 + 2
3. 1 + 3
4. 2 + 2
test_00:
counting_change(4, [1, 2, 3]) # -> 4
test_01:
counting_change(8, [1, 2, 3]) # -> 10

def counting_change(amount, coins):
    return _counting_change(amount, coins, 0, {})

def _counting_change(amount, coins, i, memo):
    key = (amount, i)
    if key in memo: return memo[key]
    if amount == 0: return 1
    if i >= len(coins): return 0

    coin = coins[i]
    num_ways = 0
    for qty in range(0, (amount//coin)+1):
        remainder = amount - qty*coin 
        num_ways += _counting_change(remainder, coins, i+1, memo)
    memo[key] = num_ways
    return memo[key]

print(counting_change(4, [1, 2, 3]))
print(counting_change(8, [1, 2, 3]))
