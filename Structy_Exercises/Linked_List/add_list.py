'''
Write a function, add_lists, that takes in the head of two linked lists, each representing a number. 
The nodes of the linked lists contain digits as values. The nodes in the input lists are reversed; 
this means that the least significant digit of the number is the head. 
The function should return the head of a new linked listed representing the sum of the input lists. 
The output list should have its digits reversed as well.

Say we wanted to compute 621 + 354 normally. The sum is 975:

   621
 + 354
 -----
   975

Then, the reversed linked list format of this problem would appear as:

    1 -> 2 -> 6
 +  4 -> 5 -> 3
 --------------
    5 -> 7 -> 9
test_00:
#   621
# + 354
# -----
#   975

a1 = Node(1)
a2 = Node(2)
a3 = Node(6)
a1.next = a2
a2.next = a3
# 1 -> 2 -> 6

b1 = Node(4)
b2 = Node(5)
b3 = Node(3)
b1.next = b2
b2.next = b3
# 4 -> 5 -> 3

add_lists(a1, b1)
# 5 -> 7 -> 9
test_01:
#  7541
# +  32
# -----
#  7573

a1 = Node(1)
a2 = Node(4)
a3 = Node(5)
a4 = Node(7)
a1.next = a2
a2.next = a3
a3.next = a4
# 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7

b1 = Node(2)
b2 = Node(3)
b1.next = b2
# 2 -> 3 

add_lists(a1, b1)
# 3 -> 7 -> 5 -> 7
